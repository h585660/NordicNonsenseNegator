# NordicNonsenseNegator 🐍⚡

## About This Project 🚀

NordicNonsenseNegator is not your average Python script. It's a rebel in a world of convoluted power usage data, crafted by someone who found their own electricity bill suspiciously high and the online data as clear as mud. This is for my fellow Norwegians who, like me, refuse to pay those electricity-fatcats for their fancy hour-by-hour services. 💸🐱‍👤

So, I cooked up this nifty script that chews through the 'nettleverandor' CSV format and spits out something a mere mortal can understand. It's like giving a makeover to your worst nightmare – but in CSV format.

**Disclaimer**: If you're not from Norway, this script will be as useful to you as a chocolate teapot. 🍫🫖

## Features That Will Blow Your Woolen Socks Off 🧦💥

- **Data Decipherer**: Transforms the hieroglyphics in the 'nettleverandor' CSV files into actual human-readable information.
- **Brute-Force Beauty**: It's not pretty, but it gets the job done. Like a bulldozer in a flower bed.
- **Visualization Virtuoso**: Generates graphs that even your grandma could read (if she's into that sort of thing).
- **Customizable**: For those who like to tinker around. You're an intermediate Python programmer? Go nuts!🥜 Hardcoded CSV-data screams for your attention
- **Absolutely Zero Effort in Aesthetics**: It's like a programmer's version of bed hair. Functional but messy.

## Getting Started 🚦

1. **Install Python**. If you haven't already, are you really living in 2023?
2. **Clone this repository**: https://github.com/h585660/NordicNonsenseNegator.git
3. **Download your CSV file from Elhub**: You know the drill, go to Elhub, enter your info, do a little dance, download your data.

## Usage Instructions 📖

1. **Update the `file_path` in the script** to where your CSV file is crying for help.
2. **Run the script**: python3 nordic_nonsense_negator.py Watch the magic happen and bask in the glory of readable data.

## A Big, Sarcastic Thank You 👏

- To the electricity companies for their less-than-clear data presentations. Couldn't have done it without you, really.
- To coffee, for keeping me awake while I fought an entire 8-15 workday through this csv format. ☕

**Happy Power-Tracking, Norway!** 🇳🇴💡🔍
